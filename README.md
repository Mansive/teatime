This is a repository for the [Kemono Teatime](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2698470/Kemono_Teatime/) script in Agent. The design language and assets are based on the game, and work was done to adapt them to a web context.

I've wrote down some of the things I learned while working on this project in `notes`.

Run `node inline_assets.js` to generate CSS with inlined assets. Output is located in the `build` directory.
