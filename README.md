This is a repository for the [Kemono Teatime](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2698470/Kemono_Teatime/) script in Agent. The design language and assets are based on the game, and work was done to adapt them to a web context.

A demo page of the project is available at <https://mteatime.pages.dev/agent>. It's best viewed with a chromium-based browser, as Firefox's rendering of the CSS has several anomalies.

I've wrote down some of the things I learned while working on this project in the `notes` directory.

Run `node inline_assets.js` to generate CSS with inlined assets. Output will be placed in the `build` directory.

Here's a short demonstration of the page on its intended app, [Agent](https://github.com/0xDC00/agent):
