Used squoosh to optimize kmtt-background-pattern.png
Settings:
- OxiPNG encoder
- Effort 5
- Reduce palette colors from 256 to 2

Can't see any difference between pre and post optimization images; they actually look the exact same.
In conclusion, pixel art PNGs can be smaller than a bunch of CSS even after being encoded into Base64.
That's kinda crazy.
